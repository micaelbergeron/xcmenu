Lightweight clipboard manager for X

By default it keeps history of your XA_CLIPBOARD,
and keeps XA_PRIMARY on sync with it.

History is saved in $XDG_USER_DATA/xcmenu or $HOME/.local/share/xcmenu
By default it uses zlib compression.

Change settings in config.h
Also comes with bash script for dmenu access.

xcmenuctrl can read dmenu settings from $HOME/.dmenurc
with the variable XCMENUCTRL_DMENU, for example:
XCMENUCTRL_DMENU='dmenu -i -l 15'

By default, xcmenu uses CLEAR_SELECTIONS bitflag for,
XA_CLIPBOARD to increase compatibility with applications.

Without this flag however, you can have some extra flexibility
related to selection targets.

MISC:
   You can set clipboard data similar to xsel/xclip
   echo "asd" | xcmenu -pi # copy to primary
   echo "asd" | xcmenu -ci # copy to clipboard
   xcmenu -p               # output selection from primary
   xcmenu -c               # output selection from clipboard

   Special selections are supported as well
   xcmenu -b image/png > image.png  # get image from gimp
   xcmenu -bi image/png < image.png # upload image to image/png

Those commands will leave xcmenu process open until someone else takes ownership of the particular selection (ex. XA_CLIPBOARD).
